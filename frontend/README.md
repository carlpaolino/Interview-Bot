# Frontend

This is the user-facing web application for Interview Bot. It is built with React (Next.js) and styled with Tailwind CSS. The UI features a chat-style interface for mock interviews, dropdowns for configuration, a countdown timer, and pages for feedback and interview history.

## Main Folders
- `components/`: Reusable UI components (chat, dropdowns, timer, etc.)
- `pages/`: Next.js pages (main chat, feedback, history, etc.)
- `styles/`: Tailwind or CSS modules
- `utils/`: Frontend helpers (API calls, timer logic, etc.)
