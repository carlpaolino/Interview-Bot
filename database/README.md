# Database

This directory contains the database schema, migrations, and seed data for Interview Bot. The primary database is PostgreSQL, but the schema can be adapted for MongoDB or other stores. Optionally, a vector database (e.g. Pinecone, Weaviate) can be used for semantic search.

## Contents
- `migrations/`: DB migration scripts
- `seed/`: Seed data for development
- `schema.sql`: Main SQL schema
